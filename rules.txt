The goal of the game is to score the most
points.

Gameplay: Shapes made of blocks fall from
the top of the playing field. The player must
form lines of blocks to score points.

The more lines a single shape creates, the
more points the player receives:
1 line = 100 points;
2 lines = 300 points;
3 lines = 700 points;
4 lines (Tetris) = 1500 points.

Designations:
Lines - Number of lines formed.

of all lines formed.
